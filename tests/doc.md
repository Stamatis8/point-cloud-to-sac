# Tests

## test-1.cpp

Verify validity of `SectionalAreaXwiseYsymmetrical()` by comparing it with the analytic sectional area curve of the Wigley hull

## test-2.cpp

Test first derivative of sectional are curve generated through `SectionalAreaXwiseYsymmetrical()` at boundary points, by comparing it with the analytic version of the Wigley hull
